/**
 * A class to test whether methods are inherited not just from
 * the first parent but from all the subclassing hierarchy.
 *
 * Class BinaryTreeEmpty is a subclass of BinaryTree (abstract) 
 * which in turn is a subclass of IntegerCollection (also abstract). 
 * Implementing method IntegerCollection.size() on BinaryTreeEmpty
 * should work, even if it's not declared in the parent class.
